                            <p><strong>Personal data</strong></p>
                            <p>Personal data or personal information means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. This is a broad definition that includes the specific personal data we have described below. It does
                                not include data that cannot be used to identify an individual person, such as a company registration number.</p>
                            <p>A "data subject" is an individual who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by personal data. This is usually by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, an online identifier or
                                to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
                            <p>Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data. It does not include data in which the identity has been deleted (anonymous data).</p>
                            <p>Depending on whether and how you use our &nbsp;Application, we will collect, use, store and transfer different types of personal data about you that we have grouped into categories as follows:</p>
